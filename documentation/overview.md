### Pushing Metrics

> Occasionally you will need to monitor components which cannot be scraped. The Prometheus Pushgateway allows you to push time series from short-lived service-level batch jobs to an intermediary job which Prometheus can scrape. Combined with Prometheus's simple text-based exposition format, this makes it easy to instrument even shell scripts without a client library.

### Recording Rules

> Recording rules allow you to precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive expressions and save their result as a new set of time series. Querying the precomputed result will then often be much faster than executing the original expression every time it is needed.
