# Querying

The best way to start is by looking at the official [ðŸ”— query examples](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/examples/)


Afterwards, have a look at:
* [Basics](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)
* [Operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/)
  * For a good explanation for vector matching see [Prometheus Cheat Sheet - How to Join Multiple Metrics (Vector Matching)](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/prometheus-vector-matching/)
* [Functions](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/)
